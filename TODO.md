# ToDos


A list of ToDos, mainly for myself, do not expect consistency. Especially do not
expect that I really do anything of what I noted here any time soon.


## Implementation

- Rename std::function instances to func_abc or call_abc to mark it as callable


## Technical

- Make project compileable on Windows
- Ruby bindings (e.g. using rice)
- Python bindings


## Features

- Make selection of readers configurable (best, fastest, name...)
- Add libcdio support (CUE/BIN, TOC/BIN)
- endianess-independent reading?
