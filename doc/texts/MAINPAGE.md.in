\section features Features

- A high-level API for sample and metadata input for [libarcstk][1]
- A bunch of decoder and parser adapters to let you calculate ARCSs on your
  already archived lossless audio data
- You define the task like "Take this audio and this TOC and just give me the
  checksums"
- Lets you recalculate ARCSs of a CD image at any time after ripping
- Facility to read virtually any lossless codec from virtually any
  container file (by the use of external dependencies)
- Hides completely the concrete decoding of audio data
- Hides completely the parsing of metadata files



\section nonfeatures Non-features

- Libarcsdec does not rip CDs
- Libarcsdec is read-only and does not tag, rename or alter your files in any
  other way
- Libarcsdec does not contribute to tasks like verifying/matching, computing of
  the AccurateRip identifier, parsing the AccurateRip response etc. The API for
  those things is already provided by [libarcstk][1]
- Libarcsdec will not send any requests to AccurateRip. Libarcsdec has no
  network facilities and is not supposed to get any. The actual HTTP request for
  fetching the reference values is better performed by the HTTP client of your
  choice.



\section howtobuild How to Build
